## Rarimo Rust SDK

**A cross-platform SDK written in Rust for seamless and efficient interaction with the Rarimo protocol.**

Our mission is to provide developers with a **single, reliable, and high-performance tool** for integrating with the
Rarimo ecosystem on any platform.  
The SDK is completely **free**, **open-source**, and **community-driven**.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Cross-Platform**  
  Built from a single Rust codebase that compiles to native binaries across platforms for maximum portability and
  performance.

- **Performance & Safety**  
  Core cryptographic and protocol logic are implemented in Rust, ensuring memory safety and high-speed execution.

- **Simple & Intuitive API**  
  Complex protocol details are abstracted away, giving developers a clean and ergonomic interface.

- **Modern Tooling**  
  Powered by Mozilla‚Äôs [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/), enabling type-safe and reliable bindings across
  platforms.

- **Open Source**  
  Fully transparent and open to contributions, improvements, and extensions by the community.

## üè∑Ô∏èÔ∏è Architecture

At the heart of the SDK is a **core Rust library** that implements all logic required for interacting with the Rarimo
protocol.

Using **UniFFI**, we define the SDK‚Äôs interface in a `.udl` file (`src/rarime.udl`) and automatically generate FFI
bindings for supported platforms.

This architecture allows us to:

- Write and test complex logic **once**, in Rust
- Expose a **native and idiomatic API** to every platform
- Easily extend support for new platforms in the future

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust Toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
- [UniFFI CLI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/)

Install UniFFI:

```bash
cargo install uniffi_bindgen --version <USED_VERSION>
```

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/rarime-rust-sdk.git
cd rarime-rust-sdk

# Build the Rust library
cargo build --release

# Generate FFI bindings (example)
cargo run --bin uniffi-bindgen generate src/rarime.udl --language <target_language> --out-dir <output_dir>
```

> üß† The SDK‚Äôs core is fully portable ‚Äî you can integrate it with any language or platform supported by UniFFI.
